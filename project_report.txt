import cv2
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

def detect_faces(image_path):
    pil_image = Image.open(image_path)
    if pil_image.mode != 'RGB':
        pil_image = pil_image.convert('RGB')

        }).execute()

15. Testing
------------
Testing in the Detective007 Forensic Sketch Creation and Criminal Detection System is comprehensive and multi-layered, ensuring both functional correctness and system robustness. The testing strategy encompasses unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).

**Unit Testing:**
Each core module—such as face detection, face encoding, database operations, and user authentication—has dedicated unit tests. For example, the `test_opencv.py` script validates the accuracy of face detection using various sample images, while `test_recognition.py` checks the reliability of face encoding and matching logic. These tests use both typical and edge-case images to ensure the algorithms handle real-world variability, such as different lighting, occlusions, and image resolutions.

**Integration Testing:**
Integration tests verify the correct interaction between modules, such as the flow from image upload to face encoding and database storage. Scripts like `test_db_structure.py` and `test_connection.py` ensure that the application can connect to the Supabase backend, perform CRUD operations, and maintain data integrity across tables. These tests also check the integration of the GUI with backend services, ensuring that user actions trigger the correct backend workflows.

**System and End-to-End Testing:**
System tests simulate real user workflows, such as adding a new criminal record, uploading multiple images, and performing face matching. These tests are performed both manually and through automated scripts, covering scenarios like error handling, progress bar updates, and UI responsiveness. User acceptance testing (UAT) involves feedback from target users (e.g., law enforcement professionals) to validate usability and effectiveness in real investigative scenarios.

**Performance and Stress Testing:**
The system is tested for performance under load, such as batch uploads of images and concurrent face matching requests. Multiprocessing and asynchronous operations are validated to ensure the UI remains responsive even during heavy computation. Database queries are profiled for efficiency, and the system is monitored for memory leaks or bottlenecks.

**Regression and Continuous Testing:**
Whenever new features are added or bugs are fixed, regression tests are run to ensure existing functionality is not broken. Continuous integration (CI) tools can be configured to automate these tests, providing rapid feedback during development.

16. Security Measure (if applicable)
-------------------------------------
Security is a foundational aspect of Detective007, given the sensitive nature of criminal records and biometric data. The system employs a multi-layered security approach, combining best practices in authentication, authorization, data protection, and secure coding.

**Authentication and Authorization:**
User authentication is managed via Supabase, which provides secure email/password sign-up and sign-in workflows. Only authenticated users can access the application, and role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced. For example, only admin users can add or modify criminal records, while regular users may be limited to search and view operations. Row Level Security (RLS) policies are implemented on all database tables, ensuring that users can only access data they are authorized to see.

**Data Protection:**
All sensitive data, including face encodings and images, are stored securely in the Supabase backend. Data in transit is protected using HTTPS, and Supabase ensures encryption at rest for stored data. Face encodings are stored in a binary or base64-encoded format, making them unusable without the application logic. User credentials are never stored in plaintext, and password policies enforce strong, unique passwords.

**Secure Development Practices:**
The codebase follows secure coding guidelines, such as input validation, error handling, and the principle of least privilege. Third-party dependencies are kept up to date to mitigate known vulnerabilities. The system is regularly reviewed for potential security flaws, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and improper file handling.

**Audit and Compliance:**
All access to sensitive operations is logged, and audit trails can be generated for investigative or compliance purposes. The system is designed to be compliant with data protection regulations, such as GDPR, by allowing for data minimization, user consent, and the right to erasure.

**Backup and Recovery:**
Regular backups of the database and storage are performed to prevent data loss. Disaster recovery procedures are documented, ensuring that the system can be restored quickly in the event of a failure or breach.

In summary, Detective007 integrates robust testing and security measures at every stage of development and operation, ensuring reliability, data integrity, and protection against evolving threats.

17. Future Scope
